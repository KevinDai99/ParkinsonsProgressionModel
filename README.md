## Overview of the Analysis

### Background/Purpose of Analysis 
Our objective is to predict the progression of PD in patients by analyzing their MDS-UPDRS scores. which measure progression in patients with PD. The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a comprehensive assessment tool that measures both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with PD.

Our team developed models using data on protein and peptide levels over time in both individuals with PD, as well as in normal age-matched healthy controls. By doing so, we aim to uncover significant insights into the molecular changes that occur as PD advances, potentially leading to a groundbreaking discovery.
